# Source/Header Refactoring

This demonstrates the refactoring pattern to separate header files from implementations.

## PWM Module Example

**Before:**
- `pwm.h` contained both declarations and implementations

**After:**  
- `pwm.h` contains only declarations and constants
- `pwm.c` contains all implementations

## Pattern

1. Move function implementations from `.h` to `.c` files
2. Keep declarations, constants, and type definitions in `.h`
3. Update build system to compile `.c` files
4. Maintain identical functionality

This approach can be applied to all modules systematically to clean up the codebase structure.
