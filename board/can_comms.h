/*
  CAN transactions to and from the host come in the form of
  a certain number of CANPacket_t. The transaction is split
  into multiple transfers or chunks.

  * comms_can_read outputs this buffer in chunks of a specified length.
    chunks are always the given length, except the last one.
  * comms_can_write reads in this buffer in chunks.
  * both functions maintain an overflow buffer for a partial CANPacket_t that
    spans multiple transfers/chunks.
  * the overflow buffers are reset by a dedicated control transfer handler,
    which is sent by the host on each start of a connection.
